## Multiclass Classification *[30% impl, 20% writeup]*

In this section, you will explore the differences between three
multiclass-to-binary reductions: one-against-all (OAA), all-versus-all
(AVA) and a tree-based reduction (TREE). We are evaluating on a text 
classification task:  wine classification (sorry
if you're not a wine snob and this doesn't mean much to you). Your job is, given the
description of the wine, predict the type of wine.  There are two
tasks: WineData has 20 different wines, WineDataSmall is just the
first five of those (sorted roughly by frequency).

You can find the names of the wines both in WineData.labels as well as
the file wines.names.

To start out, be sure to import everything:

```python
>>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
>>> import multiclass
>>> import util
>>> from datasets import *
```

To get you started, here's how we can train decision "stumps" (aka
depth=1 decision trees) on the large data set:

```python
>>> h = multiclass.OAA(20, lambda: DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1))
>>> h.train(WineData.X, WineData.Y)
>>> P = h.predictAll(WineData.Xte)
>>> mean(P == WineData.Yte)
0.29499072356215211
```

That means 29% accuracy on this task. (Note that you might get a
slightly different value for accuracy due to randomization in the
SKLearn classifier implementations.) The most frequent class is:

```python
>>> mode(WineData.Y)
1
>>> WineData.labels[1]
'Cabernet-Sauvignon'
```

And if you were to always predict label 1, you would get the following
accuracy:

```python
>>> mean(WineData.Yte == 1)
0.17254174397031541
```

So we're doing a bit (12%) better than that using decision stumps.

The default implementation of OAA uses decision tree confidence
(probability of prediction) to weigh the votes. You can switch to
zero/one predictions to see the effect:

```python
>>> P = h.predictAll(WineData.Xte, useZeroOne=True)
>>> mean(P == WineData.Yte)
0.19109461966604824
```

As you can see, this is **markedly worse**.

Switching to the smaller data set for a minute, we can train, say,
depth 3 decision trees:

```python
>>> h = multiclass.OAA(5, lambda: DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3))
>>> h.train(WineDataSmall.X, WineDataSmall.Y)
>>> P = h.predictAll(WineDataSmall.Xte)
>>> mean(P == WineDataSmall.Yte)
0.60393873085339167
>>> mean(WineDataSmall.Yte == 1)
0.40700218818380746
```

So using depth 3 trees we get an accuracy of about 60% (this number
varies a bit), versus a baseline of 41%. That's not too terrible, but
not great.

We can look at what this classifier is doing.

```python
>>> WineDataSmall.labels[0]
'Sauvignon-Blanc'
>>> util.showTree(h.f[0], WineDataSmall.words)
```

This should show the tree that's associated with predicting label 0
(which is stored in h.f[0]). The 1s mean "likely to be
Sauvignon-Blanc" and the 0s mean "likely not to be".

**WU1 (20%):** Answer questions A, B and C for both OAA and AVA.

(A) What words are most indicative of *being* Sauvignon-Blanc? Which
words are most indicative of not being Sauvignon-Blanc? What about
Pinot-Noir (label==2)?

(B) Train depth 3 decision trees on the full WineData task (with 20
labels). What accuracy do you get? How long does this take (in
seconds)? One of my least favorite wines is Viognier -- what words are
indicative of this?

(C) Compare the accuracy using zero-one predictions versus using
confidence. How much difference does it make?

**WU2 (30%):**

Now, you must implement a tree-based reduction. Most of train is given to you, but predict you
must do all on your own. A tree class is provided to help you:

```python
>>> t = multiclass.makeBalancedTree(range(6))
>>> t
[[0 [1 2]] [3 [4 5]]]
>>> t.isLeaf
False
>>> t.getLeft()
[0 [1 2]]
>>> t.getLeft().getLeft()
0
>>> t.getLeft().getLeft().isLeaf
True
```

## Gradient Descent and Linear Classification *[30% impl, 20% writeup]*

### Gradient descent

To get started with linear models, we will implement a generic
gradient descent methods.  This should go in `gd.py`, which
contains a single (short) function: `gd` This takes five
parameters: the function we're optimizing, it's gradient, an initial
position, a number of iterations to run, and an initial step size.

In each iteration of gradient descent, we will compute the gradient
and take a step in that direction, with step size `eta`.  We
will have an *adaptive* step size, where `eta` is computed
as `stepSize` divided by the square root of the iteration
number (counting from one).

Once you have an implementation running, we can check it on a simple
example of minimizing the function `x^2`:

```python
>>> import gd
>>> gd.gd(lambda x: x**2, lambda x: 2*x, 10, 10, 0.2)
(1.0034641051795872, array([ 100.        ,   36.        ,   18.5153247 ,   10.95094653,
          7.00860578,    4.72540613,    3.30810578,    2.38344246,
          1.75697198,    1.31968118,    1.00694021]))
```

You can see that the "solution" found is about 1, which is not great
(it should be zero!), but it's better than the initial value of ten!
If yours is going up rather than going down, you probably have a sign
error somewhere!

We can let it run longer and plot the trajectory:

```python
>>> x, trajectory = gd.gd(lambda x: x**2, lambda x: 2*x, 10, 100, 0.2)
>>> x
0.003645900464603937
>>> plot(trajectory)
>>> show(False)
```

It's now found a value close to zero and you can see that the
objective is decreasing by looking at the plot.

**WU3 (5%):** What is the impact of the step size on convergence? Find values of the step size where the algorithm diverges and converges.

-1, -2 diverge
0 is constant
0.2 converges, 0.5 finds the optimum in one step!

**WU4 (10%):** Come up with a *non-convex* univariate
optimization problem.  Plot the function you're trying to minimize and
show two runs of `gd`, one where it gets caught in a local
minimum and one where it manages to make it to a global minimum.  (Use
different starting points to accomplish this.)

If you implemented it well, this should work in multiple dimensions,
too:

```python
>>> x, trajectory = gd.gd(lambda x: linalg.norm(x)**2, lambda x: 2*x, array([10,5]), 100, 0.2)
>>> x
array([ 0.0036459 ,  0.00182295])
>>> plot(trajectory)
```

### Linear Classifiers

Our generic linear classifier implementation is
in `linear.py`.  The way this works is as follows.  We have an
interface `LossFunction` that we want to minimize.  This must
be able to compute the loss for a pair `Y` and `Yhat`
where, the former is the truth and the latter are the predictions.  It
must also be able to compute a gradient when additionally given the
data `X`.  This should be all you need for these.

There are three loss function stubs: `SquaredLoss` (which is
implemented for you!), `LogisticLoss` and `HingeLoss`
(both of which you'll have to implement.  We suggest holding off
implementing the other two until you have the linear classifier
working.

The `LinearClassifier` class is a stub implemention of a
generic linear classifier with an l2 regularizer.  It
is *unbiased* so all you have to take care of are the weights.
Your implementation should go in `train`, which has a handful
of stubs.  The idea is to just pass appropriate functions
to `gd` and have it do all the work.  See the comments inline
in the code for more information.

Once you've implemented the function evaluation and gradient, you can
test this.  Let's begin with a very simple 2D example data set so that
 solutions can be plotted.  Let's also start with *no
regularizer* to help you figure out where errors might be if you
have them.  (You'll have to import `mlGraphics` to make this
work.)

```python
>>> import linear
>>> f = linear.LinearClassifier({'lossFunction': linear.SquaredLoss(), 'lambda': 0, 'numIter': 100, 'stepSize': 0.5})
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(f, datasets.TwoDAxisAligned)
Training accuracy 0.91, test accuracy 0.86
>>> f
w=array([ 2.73466371, -0.29563932])
>>> mlGraphics.plotLinearClassifier(f, datasets.TwoDAxisAligned.X, datasets.TwoDAxisAligned.Y)
>>> show(False)
```

Note that even though this data is clearly linearly separable,
the *unbiased* classifier is unable to perfectly separate it.

If we change the regularizer, we'll get a slightly different
solution:

```python
>>> f = linear.LinearClassifier({'lossFunction': linear.SquaredLoss(), 'lambda': 10, 'numIter': 100, 'stepSize': 0.5})
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(f, datasets.TwoDAxisAligned)
Training accuracy 0.9, test accuracy 0.86
>>> f
w=array([ 1.30221546, -0.06764756])
```

As expected, the weights are *smaller*.

Now, we can try different loss functions.  Implement logistic loss and
hinge loss.  Here are some simple test cases:

```python
>>> f = linear.LinearClassifier({'lossFunction': linear.LogisticLoss(), 'lambda': 10, 'numIter': 100, 'stepSize': 0.5})
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(f, datasets.TwoDDiagonal)
Training accuracy 0.99, test accuracy 0.86
>>> f
w=array([ 0.29809083,  1.01287561])

>>> f = linear.LinearClassifier({'lossFunction': linear.HingeLoss(), 'lambda': 1, 'numIter': 100, 'stepSize': 0.5})
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(f, datasets.TwoDDiagonal)
Training accuracy 0.98, test accuracy 0.86
>>> f
w=array([ 1.17110065,  4.67288657])
```

**WU5 (5%):** For each of the loss functions, train a model on the
binary version of the wine data (called WineDataBinary) and evaluate
it on the test data. You should use lambda=1 in all cases. Which works
best? For that best model, look at the learned weights. Find
the *words* corresponding to the weights with the greatest
positive value and those with the greatest negative value.
Hint: look at WineDataBinary.words to get the id-to-word
mapping. List the top 5 positive and top 5 negative and explain.
